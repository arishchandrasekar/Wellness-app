I can definitely help with that. \n\nSince you mentioned you're 16, I assume you'd like to know the timeline for people assigned female at birth (AFAB). Please let me know if this isn't the case, and we can adjust accordingly. ðŸ˜Š\n\n**Here's a general idea of when puberty changes *typically* happen for those AFAB:**\n\n* **8-13 years old:**\n    * Breasts start to develop (usually starting with a small bud under the nipple)\n    * Pubic hair starts to grow (it may be fine and light at first, then become coarser and darker)\n* **9-14 years old:**\n    * Growth spurt begins (you might get taller quickly!)\n    * Vaginal discharge starts (it might be clear or whitish, and it's normal!)\n* **10-15 years old:**\n    * Periods usually start (this could be anywhere from 2.5 to 4.5 years after your breasts start to develop)\n    * Armpit hair starts to grow\n    * Skin and hair may become more oily\n* **16-17 years old:**\n     *  Puberty usually finishes around this time, but everyone develops at their own pace. \n\n**Important things to remember:**\n\n* **Everyone is different:** This is just a general timeline, and some people may start puberty earlier or later than others.  It's totally normal!\n* **Don't compare yourself to others:**  Focus on your own journey. If you have any concerns about your development, it's always best to talk to a doctor or trusted adult. \n* **Puberty takes time:** It can take several years for all the changes to happen, so be patient with yourself and your body. \n\nI hope this helps!
